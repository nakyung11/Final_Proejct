## Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS)

-   National Cancer Institute (NCI)
-   Digital health technology use
-   Health information-seeking behavior
-   Cancer awareness and preventive health practices

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Research Questions

-   RQ1: How do **demographic and socio-economic factors** differ between Telehealth users and non-users?
-   RQ2: How do **social media usage frequency and health information engagement levels** differ between Telehealth users and non-users?
-   RQ3: How do **cancer-related risk perceptions** differ between Telehealth users and non-users?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## RQ1. Demographic factors and Telehealth Usage

::: incremental
### My Journey

-   The dataset includes variables on age group, gender, ethnicity, education, income, and telehealth care usage.

-   Column names were renamed for consistency and clarity. Responses were recoded into numeric scales, and missing values were effectively removed.

-   Visualizations, including bar plots and summary tables, were generated to illustrate demographic patterns and telehealth usage.
:::

::: incremental
### Challenges I Faced 

-   Cleaning and restructuring the dataset (e.g., handling missing data for variables like Telehealth usage, Ethnicity, etc.).

-   Re-encoding and categorizing variables (e.g., grouping income ranges, recoding gender and ethnicity categories).

-   Managing discrepancies between data types during transformation (pivot_longer and pivot_wider).
:::

::: incremental
### Victories to Celebrate

-   Successfully created a clean dataset with well-defined variables (e.g., Age, Gender, Education, Income, Ethnicity).

-   Generated insightful visualizations to represent telehealth usage distribution across demographics.

-   Comprehensive summary statistics table highlighting demographic distributions and telehealth service usage.

### Findings

-   **Age**: Telehealth adoption was highest among middle-aged adults (35-44) and lowest among older adults (65+).

-   **Gender**: Female participants were slightly more likely to engage with telehealth services than males.

-   **Ethnicity**: White respondents dominated telehealth usage, with moderate representation from Hispanic and Black groups.
:::

::: incremental
### Findings

-   **Education**: Higher education levels, especially college graduates and postgraduates, correlated strongly with telehealth adoption.

-   **Income**: Telehealth usage increased significantly with higher income levels, particularly among those earning \$75K-\$199K or more.
:::

::: incremental
### Continuing Challenges

-   Improving the readability and interpretability of demographic summaries for broader audiences.

-   Refining visualizations to emphasize critical findings without overwhelming the audience.

-   Addressing minor inconsistencies in the summarized percentages.
:::

::: incremental
### Next R Hurdle

-   Incorporating inferential statistical techniques (e.g., chi-square tests) to assess relationships between demographics and telehealth usage.

-   Exploring interaction effects between variables like income and education on telehealth adoption.

-   Automating summary and visualization processes for scalability.

## RQ3. Cancer Risk Perception and Telehealth Usage

**How do cancer-related risk perceptions differ between Telehealth users and non-users?**

1.  My Journey:

-   selected relevant columns (cancer risk perception: screening willingness, worry, susceptibility, beliefs about causes, prevention feasibility)

-   renamed variables into simpler names

-   recoded responses into consistent numeric scales

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  My Journey (continued):

-   cleaned missing or inapplicable data

-   combined cancer risk perception factors into a single variable and categorized them into three levels (low, medium, and high) based on their average point

-   created data visualization and summary statistics tables

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.  Challenges I Faced, but Succeeded:

-   data cleaning: recoding several variables that had different criteria into a consistent numeric formats without any mistakes

-   grouping data: calculating averages across multiple columns using mutate()

-   visualization: using 'dodge' position in geom_bar

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.  My Cool Figures!\
    can anyone help me inserting an image? I made 'images' folder and saved a png file of my bar chart but I can't insert it in this slides :(

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.  Substantive Findings

-   Regardless of cancer risk perception level, there are more people who have never used telehealth than those who have.
-   Individuals with higher risk perceptions are more likely to have used telehealth compared to those with lower risk perceptions
-   Still, People with high cancer risk perception tend to use telehealth less than those with medium risk perception.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.  Continuing Challenges

-   Refining the grouping criteria for low, medium, and high based on their average scores? or sum scores?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.  Next R Hurdle

-   Learning how to conduct more complicated statistical analysis to deepen understanding of the relationship between cancer risk perception and Telehealth usage, beyond the distribution
